//NOTE: Since we are compiling ClassA, ClassB does not need "css_import ClassA.cs" as ClassA is already known. In fact, adding "css_import ClassA.cs" will result in an error as ClassA is already present
//We could however use "css_import ClassA.cs, rename_namespace(null, SomeNameSpace);" to import ClassA under a new namespace.
//More info on this topic can be found here http://www.csscript.net/help/Importing_scripts.html
