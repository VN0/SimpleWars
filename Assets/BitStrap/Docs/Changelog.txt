# Changelog #

### 1.8 ###

+ HashSetExtensions: similar to DictionaryExtensions but for HashSet
+ TransformEditor: similar to the stock editor but with individual reset buttons next to each property
+ Collision/TriggerListener: enables you to control exactly what scripts receive Collision/Trigger events and from which colliders
+ ComponentReference: saves a reference to a component that can be easily retrieved where ComponentReference is located
* Timer: now works normally even if you call "OnUpdate()" more than once on Update
* AnimatorProperties: they now can be used even if there's no sibling Animator component
- ParticleSystemHelper: its functionality was not compliant with Unity's new way of handling ParticleSystems
- "Sort Components", "Move to Top", "Move to Bottom": this feature was a "hack". Since 5.5, it's broken because of some Unity internal refactorings.
